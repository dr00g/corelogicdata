# home buying helper

this project aims to build a tool that will assist me in buying a home in australia.

i am starting this project with no skills in software development so i will be documenting my learning process throughout this project.

i am starting this project because:
* i personally find it overwhelming to regularly search for properties on www.domain.com.au within the range of borrowing power i have, stay on top of new listings that interst me, see historical data for properties i have been interested in, and add my own notes to a property if i inspect it
* domain and other real estate platforms do not always tell you the sold price of a property
* there is a common practice in australian real estate sales to underquote the value of a property which makes it difficult to accurately gauge the reasonable expected final sale price (2bed units quoted at $750k regularly going for >$850k) ultimately wasting my time as a buyer if i am inspecting properties i have no realistic chance of owning based on my borrowing power
* www.corelogic.com.au is the leading provider of property data (sales and property metadata) however, their dataset is not cheap with access priced at >$100 AUD/month
* many young homebuyers like myself are opting to use the services of a buyers agent, however, these services are not cheap and can often be tens of thousands of dollars. this is money i can't afford to spend when the current interest rates decrease my borrowing power
* i would like to be more considered in my approach to searching for properties so that i don't spend as many weekends on fruitless opportunties
* i would like to have a rough idea of the trends in neighbourhoods im interested around the problem of underquoting
